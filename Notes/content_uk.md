The following topics are discussed in the course.
1. Introduction to Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)
- What are DSLs?
- When are DSLs used?
- What properties are specific to DSLs?
- What types of DSLs are distinguished?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using DSLs?
2. Basics of compilation
- What is a compilation?
- What is the structure of the compiler?
- * What is the lexical analyzer used for?
- * What is the parser used for?
- * What is the semantic analyzer used for?
- * What is the translator used for?
- How are the various structural components of the compiler related to each other?
3. Necessary information on the theory of formal languages
- What is formal language?
- How to define a formal language to ensure the solution to the problem of recognizing the correct words?
- Why is N. Chomsky's general grammar, not a good tool for defining a formal language?
- What is N. Chomsky's hierarchy?
- How are automata and regular languages related to finite automata?
- How are context-free languages and vending machines related?
- A few words about attributive grammar.
4. Basics of development of DSLs
- What are the abstract and concrete syntax of a language?
- How to use languages for defining languages (metalanguage)?
- An example language for defining languages.
- A typical process of developing DSLs.
5. We build a lexical analyzer
- How to synthesize finite state automata for recognizing language tokens?
- How to integrate finite state automata for token recognition into a lexical analyzer?
6. We build a parser
- What is parsing by recursive descent?
- Which is grammar suitable for parsing by recursive descent?
- How to build a grammar suitable for parsing by recursive descent without changing the language?
7. We build a translator
- What is syntax-directed translation?
- How to build a syntax-directed translator?
- What to do in more complicated cases?
